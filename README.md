## AoC Year 2 - The Polyglot strikes back

Hoping to make this ANOTHER year of "Polyglot" Advent of Code.

The idea is to try to solve the various puzzles in one of `Golang`, `Java`, `Kotlin`, `C#`, `Node` and `Python`  (maybe rotate each day?!)  I'm not necessarily going for the most 
concise solution but rather one that I either find clever or lets me practice something from the language I want to exercise.

Thank you to the [CapTech](https://captechconsulting.com/) crew for throwing down the gauntlet and helping to keep me inspired/on track throughout the challenge
